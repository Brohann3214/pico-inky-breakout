# pico-inky-breakout
a simple clone of atari's breakout for the pimoroni pico inky pack. please note that I did not make this entirely by myself and had help from chatGPT
# how to install
all you have to do is either download the main.py and transfer it to your pico, or copy and paste the code into thonny
# how to run game from another script
if are making a menu for your inky pack and want to add this to your games section, download the code, rename it "breakout.py" and use "exec(open("breakout.py").read())" to start the game
